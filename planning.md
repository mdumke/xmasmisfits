## assets

```yml
- images:
    - calendar image
    - door numbers
    - title
    - speaker test button
    - start button
    - favicon

- audio:
    - doors
    - clicks
    - ambience

- packages:
    - music + images + info

- text:
    - welcome / about
```

## decisions

- [x] One canonical-size image, pixel-perfect interactions, no retina support
- [x] Once a door is open, it stays open
- [x] All items will be videos, streamed via youtube
- [x] Weirdly long screens see the calandar image at the top, not centered
- [x] No doors on top of animations
- [x] a speaker test makes sense
- [x] all doors will have the same size
