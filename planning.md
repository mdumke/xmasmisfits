## assets

```yml
- ui / ux:
    - title and loading screen
      - with loudness / speaker test ?
    - texts

- images:
    - calendar image
    - [doors]
    - title graphics
    - favicon
    - page background (?)
    - audio player icons/buttons

- audio:
    - doors
    - clicks
    - ambience

- packages:
    - music + images + info
```

## decisions

- [x] One canonical-size image, pixel-perfect interactions, no retina support
- [x] Once a door is open, it stays open
- [x] All items will be videos, streamed via youtube
- [x] Weirdly long screens see the calandar image at the top, not centered
- [x] No doors on top of animations
- [ ] does a speaker test make sense?
