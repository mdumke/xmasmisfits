      - with loudness / speaker test ?
    - texts

- images:
    - calendar image
    - [doors]

```

## decisions

- [x] One canonical-size image, pixel-perfect interactions, no retina support

- [x] All items will be videos, streamed via youtube
- [x] Weirdly long screens see the calandar image at the top, not centered
- [ ] does a speaker test make sense?
